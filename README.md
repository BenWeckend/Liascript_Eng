## Question: Should Robots be weaponized?

Open Letter Opposing Weaponization of general purpose robots | Boston Dynamics
https://www.bostondynamics.com/open-letter-opposing-weaponization-general-purpose-robots

difference between weaponized robots and weaponized machines
teleoperated drone vs robots



### Pros:

+ more efficiency on battlefields and faster reaction

+ missions that are dull, dirty or dangerous

+ hazardous enviroment

+ cost (no wages, food, training etc)

+ less loss of human life

+ might lead to less collotaral damage



### Cons:

+ development military AI may reduce acceptance for "normal" 

+ who is responsible for the actions and failiures

+ can they keep control

+ what happens when AI goes rogue... because thats totally gonna happen, thats definitly how AI works (AI isn't intelligent enough)

+ might be easier to start a war

# Human shaped robots
## Question
> Is there a need for human shaped robots?
### Where used?

- **Hospitality:** Some humanoid robots, are pouring and serving customer drinks and snacks at self-contained kiosks in Spain. Some are even working as hotel concierges and in other customer facing roles.
- **Education:** Humanoid Robots are working with students in educational settings, creating content and teaching programming.
- **Healthcare:** Other humanoid robots are providing services in healthcare settings, like communicating patient information and measuring vital signs.


### Why used?


- humans are used to the "interface" of expressions
- The shape is used to predict the movements of the robot by humans
- Problem: If the robot is too human-like we feel uncomfortable, in technical language this is called **Uncanny Valley**. The well-being increases when the robot is abstract or 100% human-like.

### pro arguments

- easier interaction -> we are used to interaction human-human 
- forget that it is only a machine

{{1}}
### contra arguments

- when the illusion isn't good it's creepy 
- robots get hard to differ humans from / sparkes emotions and empathy from humans -> hard to sacrifice 
- transfer of human values to the robot 


### summary 
- depends on the use 
- thin line between work and useful and also scary to some people





# Algorithm
## What is an Algorithm

An algorithm is a unique set of instructions for solving a problem or a class of problems. Algorithms consist of a finite number of well-defined individual steps. Thus, they can be implemented in a computer program for execution, but can also be formulated in human language.

### What does an Algorithm has to look like?

1. explicit
2. executeable
3. finite
4. terminating
5. determinated (same Input = same Output)
6. deterministic (next step is always defined)

# Legs

## Our question

> Why do we care about legs? (Feet?) 
### Reasons for the useage of legs

* Legs add stability in rough terrain 
* The human made environment is made for creatures with legs

### Reasons against the useage of legs

* Legs add complexity in hardware and software
* Legs add instability due to the reduction of contact points with the ground while walking

### Alternatives to legs

* "Legwheels" combine the capability of legs on rough terrain with the simplicity of wheels

* Soft robotics form robots which can adapt to the environment via the flexibility of their actuators
